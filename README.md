# 42_docker-1
First project to discover Docker's ecosystem and to create first containers using Dockerfiles.
It is part of the DevOps branch with "init" and "roger-skyline-1" projects.

# Expected Result
All the commands and scripts (Dockerfiles) used in this project are uploaded in this repository.  
They are structured in two parts, following the subject structure: 00_how_to_docker and 01_dockerfiles.  
The complete process is described in a documentation that I initiated.

# Special Docs
Following the great success of the initiative taken in the 'Init' and 'roger-skyline-1' projects, a unique document has been created for this project, starting from scratch.  
In this rare document you can follow the subject with a reminder for all notions learned, but also explanations for each script/command.  
It has been designed to be very complete in terms of informations, and represents dozens of hours of research and writing.  
It takes the form of a tutorial of 45 pages allowing you to be guided step by step and to complete the project from A to Z.  
It can be shared upon request.  

I would like to thanks a lot the 42 peers (and friends) who helped me to produce these documents: Julia A. and Radhoin H.  

Unfortunately only French is available for now, the content is organised as below:
